This repository contains the files and links supporting the analysis on the given dataset.

The dbt project to build the tables is contained in the fetch/dbt folder, and the notebook used to create reports and charts in fetch/data_quality is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ntpO1bUFvduoFtwl9tjNBu_1DLjmYhff?usp=sharing) (Google Colab notebook) and also as a iPython notebook in fetch/notebook/.

fetch_dev.duckdb is the duckdb containing the built tables and views to answer the business questions.

fetch/message.md is the email to stakeholders and is also within the notebook.
